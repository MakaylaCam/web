    Hello World! My name is Makayla Cambiano. I am currently in my second semester in the Library Science program at The University of Missouri. I have a Bachelor of Arts in World History from the University of Missouri-Kansas City. My focus there was on classical history and antiquity. I am also a lover of the arts; I paint and enjoy other forms of creation. My favorite places are often art museums and cafes. I do not have any experience with web development, but I am very excited to learn. I hope to learn more about coding, I have some basic knowledge, but I would love to improve myself. I also hope this class will challenge me! In my free time, I love to travel, write poems, and paint. I am living abroad currently in Albina and later Germany. The world has so many wonderful things to see, and I just want to experience all I can.
